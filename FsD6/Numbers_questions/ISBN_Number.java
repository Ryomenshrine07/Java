//An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is a 10 digit number that is used to identify a book.
//        The first nine digits of the ISBN number are used to represent the
//        Title, Publisher and Group of the book and
//        the last digit is used for checking whether ISBN is correct or not.
//
//        The first 9 digits of it, can take any value between 0 and 9,
//        but the last digits, sometimes may take value equal to 10; this is done by writing it as ‘X’.
//
//        To verify an ISBN, calculate 10 times the first digit, plus 9 times
//        the second digit, plus 8 times the third digit and so on until we add 1 time the last digit.
//        If the final number leaves no remainder when divided by 11, the code is a valid ISBN.
